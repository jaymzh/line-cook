# Example line-cook.yaml configuration

# Bot label for PRs and issues (singular)
bot_label: "line-cook"

# Label for split PRs
split_label: "line-cook-pr-split"

# Bot command prefix
bot_command_prefix: "#linecook"

# Base branch for PRs (defaults to "main")
base_branch: "main"

# Prefix for PR branch names (defaults to "line-cook")
pr_branch_prefix: "line-cook"

# Additional universe upstreams
# Each entry requires 'prefix' and 'repo_url'
# Remote names are automatically: {prefix}_upstream (e.g., pd_upstream)
universe_upstreams:
  pd-chef-cookbooks:   # name doesn't matter, just needs to be unique
    prefix: pd
    repo_url: https://github.com/jaymzh/chef-fb-api-cookbooks.git
    branch: main        # Optional, defaults to 'main'
    ignore_cookbooks: []  # Optional, defaults to empty list

  # You can add more upstreams:
  # another-upstream:
  #   prefix: xyz
  #   repo_url: https://github.com/example/chef-cookbooks.git
  #   ignore_cookbooks:
  #     - xyz_test

# While you should never need to, but if for some strange reason you need
# to change the configuration for the primary FB upstream repo, you can use
# the `upstream_overrides` key, and accepts any key that a universe upstream
# would accept. For example:
#
#   upstream_overrides:
#     ignore_cookbooks:
#       - ...
#
# Note that by default `fb_init` and `fb_init_sample` are ignored in the
# primary repo.
